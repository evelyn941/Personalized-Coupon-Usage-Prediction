# Personalized-Coupon-Usage-Prediction
Big data on users' online browsing, purchase behaviors, and offline visiting and purchasing activities is highly accessible in current O2O (Online to Offline) context. A key marketing strategy in O2O is the use of coupons to attract or retain customers. However, random coupon distribution can cause irrelevant disruptions for most users and damage brand reputation while driving up marketing costs. Personalized coupon targeting, based on user preferences, can increase coupon redemption rates and maximize marketing effectiveness.

The goal here is to predict whether users will use coupons within 15 days of receiving them by analyzing data such as user and merchant IDs, online behavior, coupon details, and location, to optimize personalized coupon distribution.
